**Learning to use Chart.js**

### What language, library, feature, service, or tool does this example demonstrate? ###
My first approach was to try and learn d3 and learn css animation, however, I realized that the work wasn't practical. I ended up demonstrating how to use Chart.js.

### Why would a web developer want to use this technology?  ###
It's a great and easy way to visualize data on charts. Learning it isn't too hard, and it's really great and easy to use. It automatically is built to be responsive which is really nice.

### What problem(s) does it solve? ###
It comes packaged with a very responsive graph interface. It solves the issue of looking at charts in a way that is simple, clean and engaging for both designers and developers.

### Why might a web developer be cautious about using this technology? What limitations, weaknesses, or drawbacks does this technology have? Does it have an active development community or does it look abandoned? How many projects seem to use this technology? If there is a public GitHub repo for this, when was the last commit, how many open issues do they have, and are those issues being addressed? ###
A web developer might be cautious about using this technology mainly because although it comes out with a very clean, responsive, and interactive chart interface, it has several limitations. Although they market themselves to be very flexible, it seemed as though there were a lot of limitations in terms of how to display your dataset.

As stated above, most of the limitations come from only being able to visualize data in the 6 different forms they provide (bar chart, line chart, pie chart, radar chart, polar area chart, doughnut chart)

It does have an active development community, however, it seems that not a lot of people use Chart.js based on the limited number of examples that show up when searching other ways to use their interface.

Their last commit was about 9 days ago, which isn't too bad. However their number of open issues is a whopping `394`. Most of those issues are still being solved. If there are issues, however, people do seem to be very helpful and responsive on stackoverflow.

### What is your example site/app and how does it demonstrate the value of your chosen technology? ###
My example website visualizes the number of people fatalities that have occurred this year because of the police. I used Chart.js as a simple way to show that there is a huge gap between the number of men killed by police versus women. It was also very interesting to see that the amount of people who were shot were not mostly people with mental illnesses.

### How should someone run your example? ###
My example can be accessed through [here](http://students.washington.edu/mlee5394/info343/toolbox-challenge/).

### Where should a web developer go to learn more about this technology? ###
To learn more about Chart.js I would definitely go and look at their [documentation](http://www.chartjs.org/docs/). It was the most help out of anything else. It is pretty straight-forward and most of the websites I found used the same examples as the ones in the original documentation. [CodePen](http://codepen.io/grayghostvisuals/pen/xmBpL) is also a great one to use as well as [Tuts+](http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/build-a-dynamic-dashboard-with-chartjs--webdesign-14363).
